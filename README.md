# Burgers

My name is Hai Nguyen. I created this application (Eat-Da-Burgers) as part of the homework assignment for the Full Stack Web Development class I am taking at the University of Denver. It is written in Node JavaScript, handlebars, ORM (Ojects Relational Mapping), and MySql database to store the data. When the app is first launched, it displays a list hamburgers that have not been devoured on the left and the corresponding "Devour it" buttons and a list of burgers that have been devoured on the right. At the bottom are the input text field which allows the user to enter a new burger to devour and the submit button. After a new burger is entered in the input text field and the submit button is cliced, the new burger will be displayed on the left with the corresponding "Devour it" button. If you click on any of the "Devour it", the burger will be devoured and the hamburger gets displayed to the right.
